### Hello I'm Kittipong (Bench) 🐱‍🚀

Currently, I'm a Process Engineer who passionate about coding and data science, especially for "Machine learning". I really enjoy coding with Python to get some insights from data and build models and see how our computer can learn from what we give!!!. I really was inspired by that. So, I started to learn about this field in many platforms, created and share what I have learned so far to every one.

## Skills
* Python
* SQL
* R
* BI tools i.e., power BI, Tableau, Google studio
